Create a simple Android application with a login screen. 

- The login screen should accept a username and password. 
- Upon entering valid credentials, the user should be redirected to a welcome screen. 
- Ensure that the login process is secure and follows best practices.

Requirements:
* Create a layout for the login screen with EditText fields for username and password, and a login button.
* Implement validation to ensure that both username and password fields are not empty.
* Implement a secure authentication mechanism to verify the username and password. You can use hardcoded credentials for simplicity.
* After successful authentication, navigate the user to a welcome screen displaying a welcome message.
